### Clustering Features

<br/>

| Metafeatures | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| landmark_1NN | Evaluate the performance of the 1-nearest neighbor classifier. It uses the euclidean distance of the nearest neighbor to determine how noisy is the data (multi-valued). |
| landmark_decision_node_learner | Construct a single decision tree node model induced by one single attribute. |
| landmark_decision_tree | Evaluate the performance of a single decision tree classifier. |
| landmark_lda | Evaluate the performance of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation classifier. |
| landmark_naive_bayes | Evaluate the performance of the Naive Bayes classifier. It assumes that the attributes are independent and each example belongs to a certain class based on the Bayes probability (multi-valued). |
| landmark_random_node_learner | Construct a single decision tree node model induced by a random attribute. |
| pca_95percent | Ratio of number of compenents to number of features. Components are selected so that variance explained by each of the selected components sum to over 0.95. |
| pca_kurtosis_first_pc | skewness of input data after being applied dimensionality reduction with regard to principal axes in feature space representing the directions of maximum variance in the data. |
| pca_skewness_first_pc | kurtosis of input data after being applied dimensionality reduction with regard to principal axes in feature space representing the directions of maximum variance in the data. |
